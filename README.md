### Ecom Product Service Project

I developed a backend project named Ecom Product Service using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern to manage products by their category 
and maintain an order list to store product information such as title, price, ID, category, description, etc. 
The project involved creating a RESTful API using Spring Boot, which allowed for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations efficiently. 

The database chosen for this project was MySQL, and Spring Data JPA was utilized to perform database operations and seamlessly connect with the database. 
This setup enabled the handling of over 3000 user records efficiently, ensuring data consistency and reliability. 

One of the critical aspects of this project was implementing user authentication and authorization using Spring Security, coupled with OAuth2.0.
 This enhanced the security of user accounts by ensuring that only authorized users could access certain functionalities and data.
 The implementation of OAuth2.0 provided a robust security mechanism, safeguarding user information and ensuring secure interactions within the application.

The project is thoroughly documented and uploaded on GitHub, allowing for version control and collaboration.
 The primary technologies used in this project include Java, MySQL, Spring Boot (for the web framework),
 Spring Data JPA (for database operations), Spring Security (for authentication and authorization), and Git (for version control).

This project not only demonstrated my ability to build a scalable and secure backend service but also showcased my proficiency in using modern Java frameworks
 and tools to develop robust enterprise-level applications.
